# Data Schema

fixed acidity : Tartaric acid level; contributes to the wine's acidity and flavor stability

volatile acidity : Acetic acid level; high levels lead to an unpleasant vinegar taste

citric acid : Adds freshness and flavor; low levels can make wine taste flat

residual sugar : Remaining sugar after fermentation; affects sweetness

chlorides : Salt content; affects wine taste

free sulfur dioxide : Helps prevent microbial growth and oxidation

total sulfur dioxide : Sum of free and bound forms; excessive levels can affect taste

density : Affected by sugar and alcohol content; higher density usually means sweeter wine

pH : Inversely related to acidity; lower pH means more acidic

sulphates : Adds to wine's antimicrobial and antioxidant properties

alcohol : Ethanol content by volume; typically correlates with perceived quality

quality : Score (0–10) representing the wine’s sensory quality rating

No categorical features are present; all attributes are numerical
